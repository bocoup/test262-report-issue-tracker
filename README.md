# Test262 Report - Issue Tracker

[Test262 Report](https://test262.report/) is developed and mantained by [Bocoup](https://bocoup.com/). It provides JavaScript developers with up-to-date information on the state of new and existing language features across implementations. Test262 Report is based on daily runs of [Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262), the [ECMA-262 (“ECMAScript” or “JavaScript”)](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) test suite, in nightly builds of JavaScript engines, and visualizes at-a-glance status of feature implementation progress.

We collect the data for [Test262 Report](https://test262.report/) using <a href="https://github.com/bterlson/test262-harness">Test262-harness</a> as our runner and <a href="https://github.com/bterlson/eshost">eshost</a> to map over global namespace inconsistencies between engines. We use <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsvu">jsvu</a> to install the latest engine binaries.

This repository is used as a public issue tracker to report bugs and feature requests for the report itself. Thank you for taking the time to visit this issue tracker and share your feedback. We really appreciate it!
